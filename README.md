# Mileage-Prediction---Automobile-Project
Prediction of Milage The following project aims to predict mileage per gallon(mps) using various technical specifications (features) as input to the regression algorithms

## Libraries Involved:
1. pandas
2. Numpy
3. Seaborn
4. Matplotlib

## Steps Involved:
1. Importing the libraries
2. Loading the dataset
3. Data Preprocessing
4. Study Correlation
5. Univariate Analysis
6. Bivariate Analysis
7. train and test data split
8. Building the model

## Machine Learning Steps Involved
1. Linear Regression
2. Polynomial Regression

## Conclusion
Accuracy score improves in the case of polynomial regression compared to the linear regression because it fits data much better. In this project, what we used:

Loading the dataset
Univariate analysis
multivariate analysis
